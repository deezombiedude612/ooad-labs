# Practical 01: Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design

::: tip Note
Ensure that you have gone through **Lecture 1: Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design** before attempting this practical.
:::

## Theroretical Questions

1.  Define _Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)_.
    Identify and briefly describe the phases in the SDLC.

2.  Describe the advantages of evolutionary prototyping compared to throw-away prototyping.

3.  One of the basic characteristics of object-oriented systems include the use of classes and objects.
    What is the main difference between a class and an object?

4.  Define _inheritance_.

5.  Define _polymorphism_.

6.  According to the creators of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), there are **THREE (3)**
    characteristics any modern object-oriented approach to developing information systems must possess.
    Name these characteristics.

7.  Modern object-oriented analysis and design (OOSAD) approaches support the following separate
    but interrelated architectural views of a system.

    - Functional (external) view

    - Static (structural) view

    - Dynamic (behavioral) view

    Identify what each of these architectural views' main focus is directed towards.

8.  Define _object-oriented analysis and design (OOSAD)_. What are some advantages of OOSAD?

9.  What is the Unified Process in OOSAD?
    Briefly describe each phase in the Unified Process and provide the deliverables in each phase.

## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1

Look up "system analyst" on JobStreet.
Include two snapshots of any job application listing that appears from the search results and include the hyperlinks to those listings.

After that, list down the job responsibilities that are required according to each listing.
Compare the two lists and mention which of the responsibilities listed are the same.

### Task 2

Jairus has been asked by his brother to develop a new kiosk system for his long-running family business.
The family business' daily activities revolve around typical tasks in a restaurant, such as cooking, cleaning of premises, and serving of food.
The new kiosk system is to primarily serve as an interface for take-away customers who only wish to purchase condiments and small food packs.
There are also plans to expand this initiative to include all types of food items and beverages in the future, as well as functioning as a contactless payment counter.

Suggest Jairus an SDLC approach that is suitable for developing this system.
Justify your answer by comparing how the workflow will be positively affected by this SDLC approach compared to other approaches.
