:::

## Theoretical Questions

1. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are the most common type of interfaces being used in applications today. What are THREE (3) fundamental parts that make up a GUI?

2. Define and elaborate the SIX (6) principles of user interface (UI) design.

3. Menus are one kind of navigation control that is used in certain applications. List and elaborate SIX (6) types of menus and mention when each of them should be used.

4. The purpose of messages is to inform users of the status of an interaction. List and elaborate FIVE (5) types of such messages and mention when each of them should be used.

5. Selection boxes are one type of input methods used especially in electronic forms. Elaborate the following types of selection boxes and mention when each of them should be used.

   - Checkbox
   - Radio button
   - Dropdown list box
   - Combo box
   - Slider

Take a screenshot of each type of selection box and attach them to each of your answers.

6. Elaborate the SIX (6) types of input validation checks.

## Optional Hands-On Task: e-Form Creation

Create an e-form (i.e., using Google Forms/Survey Monkey/etc.) to obtain feedback regarding a library borrowing system at a college.
Consider the following important details:

- the target demographic audience (students/lecturers/guests/etc.)
- satisfaction level with the library borrowing system
- suggestions/feedback to improve the library borrowing system

Note that this list is not exhaustive.
You are expected to expand on this list by including more relevant questions that can help elicit more useful information in order to improve the library borrowing system.

You are also required to include at least THREE (3) separate instances of both open-ended and closed-ended questions.
The form should have a proper flow and ask questions that do not stray away from the purpose of the e-form.
Consider what questions should be asked first, last, and in between.
Remember to phrase your questions properly as well.

## Diagram Drawing Revision: Context Diagram

	Go Buzz Treat System
</div>

The 'Go Buzz Treat' company is a small, independent business that sells sweets and cakes to the public.
The proprietor is very keen on baking and specializes in making homemade sweets and cakes for sale in the shop.
As well as making a lot of the confectionery sold in the shop, the proprietor also buys setts and some cakes from suppliers to increase the range of products for sale.

The proprietor keeps records of the quantities of stock he has on hand.
The stock includes raw ingredients for his baking, and also the sweets and cakes he buys from suppliers.
Once a week, the proprietor checks the stock to dispose anything that is past its 'sell by' date.
He also checks to see if any raw ingredients or pre-made sweets and cakes need to be ordered from the suppliers.
The proprietor orders supply on a 'Cash on Delivery' basis, so all deliveries are paid for immediately when they arrive.

At the end of each day the proprietor checks how many of each homemade item has been sold.
He keeps a record of these sales and uses this to decide how many of each cake or sweet to make for the following day.

Produce a Context Diagram for the above **'Go Buzz Treat' System**.
