# Practical 03: Requirements Determination & Context Diagram

::: tip Note
Ensure that you have gone through **Lecture 3: Requirements Determination** and **Lecture 4: Structuring System Process Requirements** before attempting this practical.
:::

## Theroretical Questions

1.  In requirements determination, a requirement can be defined as a statement of what the system
    must do or what characteristic it must have.
    Identify the kinds of perspective(s) taken for business/user requirements and system requirements.

2.  Briefly describe the difference between functional and non-functional requirements.

3.  For each non-functional requirement type, craft requirements that a global positioning system (GPS) should meet.

4.  List out **FOUR (4)** problems that can be encountered during requirements determination.

## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: Online Survey

Create an online survey with the title "Improving the Parking Problem at Taylor's".
Identify and arrange any necessary questions required to be answered by the targeted patrons (students and staff).
Structure your questions with at least **THREE (3)** open-ended and **THREE (3)** closed-ended questions.

### Task 2: Context Diagram

<div style="margin: 2rem auto 1rem; text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;">
	Pizza Supreme System
</div>

When regular customers call, they are asked for their phone number.
When the number is typed into a computer, the name, address, and last order date is automatically brought up on the screen.
Once the order is taken, the total, including tax and delivery, is calculated.
The order is then given to the cook.
A receipt is printed.
Occasionally, special offers (coupons) are printed.
Drivers who make deliveries give customers a copy of the receipt and a coupon (if any).
Weekly totals are kept for comparison with last year's performance.

Produce a Context Diagram for the above **Pizza Supreme System**.

_You may need to make assumptions to show a complete diagram. (e.g., prompts on selecting purchase, return database query results, what is shown after logging in)_

**Complete the given practical and submit it as your lecture attendance for Week 4.**

## Getting Started

::: danger REMEMBER!
A **data store** is data at rest.
A data store may represent one of many different physical locations for data; for example, a file folder, one or more computer-based file(s), or a notebook.

Basically, if one primarily stores data or information into an entity, it is regarded as a data store.
Data stores are not shown in Context Diagrams.
They are only shown in Data Flow Diagrams, which will be covered in the next practical session.
