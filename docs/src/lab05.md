<div style="margin: 2rem auto 1rem; text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;">
	Car Dealership System
</div>

The dealership sells both new and used cars, and it operates a service facility.
Base your design on the following business rules:

- A salesperson may sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one salesperson.
- A customer may buy many cars, but each car is bought by only one customer.
- A salesperson writes a single invoice for each car he or she sells.
- A customer gets an invoice for each car he or she buys.
- A customer may come in just to have his or her car serviced; that is, a customer need not buy a car to be classified as a customer.
- When a customer takes one or more cars in for repair or service, one service ticket is written for each car.
- The car dealership maintains a service history for each of the cars serviced. The service records are referenced by the car's serial number.
- A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechnaics, and each mechanic may work on many cars.
- A car that is serviced may or may not need parts (e.g., adjusting a carburetor or cleaning a fuel injector nozzle does not require providing new parts).

Construct an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the given system.
