# Practical 11: Installation and Operations

::: tip Note
Ensure that you have gone through **Lecture 11: Installation and Operations** before attempting this practical.
:::

## Theoretical Questions

1.  Elaborate the different types of cultural issues and/or factors that can affect the adoption or acceptance of newer technologies.

2.  Define conversion. What are the major steps during a system conversion process?

3.  Distinguish

- direct conversion and parallel conversion
- pilot conversion, phased conversion, and simultaneous conversion
- whole-system conversion and modular conversion

4. Aaron and his development team has successfully developed a new dashboard system for hospital staff to use to document inpatients' health information. They plan on upgrading a nearby busy hospital's existing system which is used daily by its staff with no downtime. Scheduled maintenance is hardly carried out due to the frequency of the existing system's use. What type of (a) conversion style, (b) conversion location, and (c) conversion module should Aaron and his team take to replace this hospital's system with their new one? Elaborate your reasoning.

5. Define change management.

6. Elaborate how user training can be used as an effective adoption strategy to introduce a new system into their existing workflow.

7. Define system maintenance. Why is it important in systems analysis and design?

	Credit Card Application System (CCAS)
</div>

Credit Card Application System (CCAS) is an information system that has been implemented at the Eastern Commercial Bank throughout Peninsular Malaysia.
The existence of such a system/service in/by the bank has tremendously improved the services provided by the credit card and sales department over the last 15 months.
The organization's objective of achieving a customer moment of value is well attained.
The ultimate system goal of the CCAS is to ensure faster and more accurate processing covering both the front-end clients and back-end users.

Potential clients who wish to apply for a credit card will submit their personal details together with all relevant document such as income tax and bank balance statements to the credit officer.

The credit officer will then process each application after 4 p.m. each day by checking the eligibility of each application against the basic requirements stored in the credit requirement record.
The officer will also run a check on the credit status of the clients with other banks.
This process is conducted as a security purpose in ensuring only viable clients with good credit status are considered.

When the application is successful, the officer will store these application details in the client record.
A letter will be sent out to the client whose application has been unsuccessful.
Clients with successful applications will then receive a letter of notification as well.

The successful client details are passed to the card manufacturer, Cards Inc., an associate of Eastern Commercial Bank for the creation of new credit cards.

1. Produce a Context Diagram for the above **Credit Card Application System (CCAS)**.

2. Hence, produce a Level-0 Data Flow Diagram based on your context diagram.

3. Identify and discuss any TWO (2) categories of feasibility study that can be conducted on the abovementioned **CCAS**.
